        <span style="font-size:30px;color:rgb(62, 5, 112)">By experiencing and exploring the complex coding when making art, one thing that stood out to me is the topic of how are video games considered art. In today's world of conceptual art, the answer to the question of whether "games are considered art" depends on the definition of art and the definition of games, and the questions raised by the same question are different on the basis of different understandings.

        <span style="font-size:30px;color:rgb(65, 0, 65)">Unlike other art forms such as painting, sculpture, architecture and film, the experience of game works needs to be mediated by game controllers such as keyboard, mouse and handle, while other art disciplines mentioned above can be experienced directly through the senses, with the exception of course of literature, but the special nature of literature itself makes it difficult to make analogies with audiovisual art in the first place. Therefore, when the status of the game is affirmed, the aesthetic place matching it will naturally appear. Of course, such "game art" is certainly very different from the game we have today.

        <span style="font-size:30px;color:rgb(46, 0, 57)">In the context of contemporary art theory, any medium that can be used by art creators to create can become part of art, and video games are no exception, but I am afraid this is not the answer we want. In fact, many of the things we take for granted in life from being scorned to being sought after by millions of people, in fact, thanks to the birth of a great figure and the trend it started, while the game does not have the existence of such a figure, the current social soil may not be conducive to the idolizations, at least for now.
